This seems too advanced for someone who is learning html for the first time but the passion of webpage development triggered me to complete this in a 9 hr nonstop working session lol.

Freecodecamp's free developer lessons are perfect for me, I have fun while learning. Have been doing their lessons for about 2 months now, pretty informative, GOATED.

This is the first video that I wathed about webpage development, taught me basic functions and design logics

This is the video that inspired me to do a design like this, this video teaches you how to format using the grid display

The animation for the hover effects were inspired by the contents of this video that teaches you how to manipulate the hover effect:

I learned how to do the handmade hamburger menu not using bootstrap from:

Actually, it is quite fun doing and learning these by myself

This is the video that I learned how to design a responsive input box, taught by the video uploader

There is also a portfolio template that I took some reference:

How to navigate: 
The main page has link to all webpages and files: About me page, educaiton page, projects page, leadership page. As well as the link to linkedin.com (not my personal linkedin, just the general one), my resume (without contact information), and a button to send someone@example.com a email (i guess this email doesnt exist).

If you go to a specific page, there is also a navbar that allows you to navigate to different pages, the page that you are in will have a different background and text color in the navbar so that you know where you are.

When the page becomes medium small (width < 1143px), the navbar will change in composition so that it does not seems weird. When the page width is < 711px, the right four buttons will turn in to a hamburger menu, clicking it will expand it, and content in the hamburger menu is consistent as the normal navbar: that the page you are in has special styling.
If you want to close the navbar, you can click any place on the screen that is not a link, then the menu will be closed. Of course, you can also click on the hamburger menu again to close it.

Every page has a "back to top" button on the bottom, when clicked, you navigate to the top of the page

There is also a footer in every page that has some social media icons, a fake email, and a fake phone number

There is a "game" to play in the "about" page: you can send any message to me and i will give you a randomized response out of 5 quotes, if you didn't enter anything, I will respond by saying that "you didn't enter anything."
The reset button allows you to clear the textbox.
Of course, I cannot save the comments in a database because I haven't started learning back-eng development yet, but this is interesting enough!

In the "projects" page, I uploaded my studybuddy and dice lab projects also in this, you can access the two labs by clicking the image.

The only "personal informaiton" that are in this portfolio is my country and city of origin, I don't consider them as "super personal", so I hope that it is fine!
