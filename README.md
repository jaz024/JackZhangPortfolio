This seems too advanced for someone who is learning html for the first time but the passion of webpage development triggered me to complete this in a 9 hr nonstop working session lol.

Freecodecamp's free developer lessons are perfect for me, I have fun while learning. Have been doing their lessons for about 2 months now, pretty informative, GOATED.

This is the first video that I wathed about webpage development, taught me basic functions and design logics

This is the video that inspired me to do a design like this, this video teaches you how to format using the grid display

The animation for the hover effects were inspired by the contents of this video that teaches you how to manipulate the hover effect:
